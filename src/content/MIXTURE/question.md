Chef has A units of solid and B units of liquid. He combines them to create a mixture. What kind of mixture does Chef produce: a solution, a solid, or a liquid?

A mixture is called :

1) A solution if A>0 and B>0,

2) A solid if B=0, or

3) A liquid if A=0.

### Input Format

* The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
* Each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B on a single line.

### Output Format

For each test case, output on a single line the type of mixture Chef produces, whether it is a Solution, Solid, or Liquid. The output is case sensitive.

### Explanation
* **Test case 1**: Chef adds both solid and liquid to the mixture, hence the mixture is a solution.

* **Test case 2**: Chef does not add solid to the mixture, hence the mixture is liquid.

* **Test case 3**: Chef does not add liquid to the mixture, hence the mixture is solid.
